            "section1": "Polymorphic malware represents a sophisticated type of malicious code that can change its underlying code patterns without affecting its functionality. By altering itself each time it infects a new system, this malware evades signature-based detection tools. Its mutations can range from modifying file names and encryption keys to reordering code segments. \n\nTraditional antivirus software relies on identifying malware by specific patterns or 'signatures.' When the malware changes these patterns, it effectively 'tricks' the system into seeing it as a new, undetectable file. Thus, polymorphic malware constantly tests the resilience of cybersecurity defenses and challenges professionals to find more advanced detection methods."
